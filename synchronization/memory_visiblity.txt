    1. Memory values seen when pthread_create() is called will be seen by new thread.
       Data written after may not necessarily be seen by the new thread.
    2. Data seen on mutex unlock (directly or waiting on a condition variable), can
       also be seen by any thread that later locks the same mutex. Again, data written
       after the mutex is unlocked may not necessarily be seen by the thread that locks
       the mutex, even if the write occurs before the lock.
    3. Memory values on thread termination, can also be seen by the thread that joins.
       Same as above for data written after termination.
    4. Memory values on signalling/broadcasting a conditioin variable can also be seen
       by any thread that is awakened by that signal or broadcast. Same as above for
       data written after the signal/broadcast.
