 *  While interesting to follow, the code is again much to
 *  bloated for the lessons scope.
 *
 *  Here are two links with a more focused aproach:
 *   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20772476/when-to-use-pthread-conditional-variables
 *   - https://gist.github.com/rtv/4989304
 *
 *  The introductory paragraph in the book does a much better job of 
 *  describing the use of a conditional variable than everything that follows:
 *  "A condition variable is used for communicating information about the state of shared data.
 *  You would use a condition variable to signal that a queue was no longer empty, or that it
 *  had become empty, or that anything else needs to be done or can be done within the shared 
 *  data manipulated by threads in your program."
 *
 *  Also important:
 *  "Condition variables do not provide mutual exclusion. You need a mutex to synchronize
 *  access to the shared data, including the predicate for which you wait. That is why you must
 *  specify a mutex when you wait on a condition variable. By making the unlock atomic with the
 *  wait, the Pthreads system ensures that no thread can change the predicate after you have 
 *  unlocked the mutex but before your thread is waiting on the condition variable."
 *
